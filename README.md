# MEG Reaction Time Tasks

The following repo documents the MEG tasks analyzed for the manuscript:
Cox. E., Tseng, J., Bells, S., Dockstader, C., Bouffet, E., … Mabbott, D. J. Neural and cognitive function in a pediatric brain injury model: the impact of task complexity.

Two tasks were used to assess performance and neural communication during minimal and higher task load during magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording. Minimal task load was assessed using a simple-go reaction time task involving two conditions higher task load was assessed using a choice reaction time task. Presentation order of tasks and conditions was counterbalanced across participants. 

## Simple-go reaction time task (~8 min)

Participants are instructed to fixate their eyes on a black cross presented on a screen during MEG recording. The black fixation cross is replaced by a green arrow pointing to the right. The arrow is accompanied by a static visual contrast grating in the lower left visual field to localize visual evoked responses to the right visual cortex. The location and dimensions of this contrast grating have been shown to elicit a strong visual evoked field in the right visual cortex at ~75ms following stimulus onset (Koelewijn et al. 2011). Participants are instructed to push a button with the thumb of their right hand as soon as the arrow appears. In the other condition, participants perform the same procedure with only two differences: the arrow now points to the left and they are instructed to push a button with the thumb of their left hand. Participants complete 100 trials of each condition. 

## Choice reaction time task (~12 min)

The fixation cross is randomly replaced with a green arrow pointing either left or right accompanied by a static visual contrast grating. Participants are instructed to press the corresponding left or right button as quickly as possible in response to the presentation of the green arrow. Participants complete 100 left arrow and 100 right arrow trials.

## Task parameters

* **Inter-stimulus interval**: 1.5-3.0 sec (jittered)
* **Stimulus presentation technology**: A Sanyo projector was used to present the stimuli on a semi-transparent white screen. To reduce the amount of electromagnetic artifact, the projector was located outside the magnetically shielded room and a light was shone inside via a cut-out hole. Mirrors bounced the image onto the screen and a zoom lens (132mm - 220mm) was used (allowing for projection of small images).
* **Presentation order of tasks/conditions**: Counterbalanced across participants
